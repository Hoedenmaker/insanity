  The sheer audacity of some people to critique this code is laughable. It's painfully obvious that those struggling with it have absolutely no business trying to understand low-level programming. This is assembly language, not some hand-holding, automated environment where the code is spoon-fed to you. If you're not capable of understanding a few basic register manipulations and memory operations, then perhaps coding in general is just beyond your reach.
  
  This isn't code for the faint of heart. If you’re getting lost, it’s not the code that’s the problem—it's the glaring lack of depth in your understanding of how computers actually work. You can't just dive into assembly with the same mindset that you bring to some bloated high-level language and expect everything to magically make sense. This requires a real understanding of the hardware, memory, registers, and execution cycles. These things are fundamental, not abstract concepts that you can conveniently ignore in favor of automatic memory management and garbage collection. If you can't get this, then maybe you should stick to playing around in your sandbox and leave real coding to those who know better.
  
  Let’s be brutally honest here: if you think that this code is not working, it’s a direct reflection of your incompetence. You clearly have no clue how deep programming goes when you strip away the layers of fluff that higher-level languages provide. You’ve probably never had to think about memory addresses, stack management, or CPU registers, because your precious language hides all that from you, making it easy to pretend you’re a competent coder. But here’s the thing: if you can't understand this, then you're not a real programmer. You’re just someone who got lucky with easier tools.
  
  And let's be clear: those who are unable to follow the logic here are not just mildly incompetent—they’re outright clueless. If you’re struggling to understand something as basic as stack frames or how the program flows from instruction to instruction, it’s because you’re not properly equipped to handle this level of complexity. You’re probably the type of person who thinks everything should be wrapped up in an easy-to-digest package, but let’s be real: programming at this level doesn’t give a damn about your comfort. This is where you either sink or swim.
  
  So, stop blaming the code. Stop pointing fingers and pretending like it’s the code's fault that you’re too lazy or too incapable to grasp something that anyone with half a brain and a genuine interest in computing should be able to follow. The problem is not the code. The problem is you. Maybe next time, before making idiotic critiques, take a long, hard look in the mirror and admit that perhaps this is simply beyond your reach.
  
(i actually dont undertand what is going on here myself)
